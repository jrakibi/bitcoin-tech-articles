In p2pk, bitcoins are sent to a public key,
The recipient must provide a valid signature to spend it

Despite being the simplest script for locking bitcoins to someone's public key, P2PK is not used as much as the similar P2PKH script

## How does it work:

The ability to lock and unlock coins is the mechanism by which we transfer bitcoin.  
*Locking* is giving some bitcoins to some entity.  
*Unlocking* is spending some bitcoins that you have received.

#### 1- Locking (ScriptPubKey):

When creating a P2PK transaction, the sender specifies the recipient's public key in the ScriptPubKey.  
**ScriptPubKey**: A P2PK locking script looks like this:

```
<recipient's public key> OP_CHECKSIG
```

This script specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the bitcoins in the future.
and it's Placed within the output of a transaction.

#### 2- Unlocking (ScriptSig)

To spend Bitcoin sent to a P2PK address, the recipient must provide a valid signature corresponding to the public key.  
**ScriptSig:** P2PK Unlocking script looks like this:

```
<signature>
```

#### 3- Validation

When a transaction is validated, the ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey are concatenated.

```
<signature> <recipient's public key> OP_CHECKSIG
```

> [!NOTE]
> OP_CHECKSIG is an opcode that verifies an ECDSA signature. It takes two inputs from the stack, a public key (on top of the stack) and an ECDSA signature. OP_CHECKSIG will push true to the stack if the check passed, false otherwise.

## Script Validation:

The combined script is executed using stack operations.

Let’s break down how it works using this animation:

### Elements

- **Definition:** Data pushed onto the stack.
- **Type:** Byte strings (1 to 520 bytes).
- **Example:** DER signatures or SEC pubkeys.

### Operations

- **Definition:** Commands that manipulate stack elements.
- **Type:** Consume and push elements.
- **Example:** `OP_DUP`, `OP_HASH160`, `OP_CHECKSIG`.

### Key Operations in P2PK

1. **OP_CHECKSIG**
   - **Function:** Verifies the ECDSA signature.
   - **Stack Operation:** Consumes 2 elements (pubkey and signature) and pushes 1 element (1 if valid, 0 if not).

### Summary Table

| Type          | Description                      | Example       | Consumption | Push            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Element**   | Data for the stack               | DER Signature | N/A         | N/A             |
| **Operation** | Duplicates the top stack element | OP_DUP        | 0 elements  | 1 element       |
| **Operation** | Hashes the top stack element     | OP_HASH160    | 1 element   | 1 element       |
| **Operation** | Verifies a signature             | OP_CHECKSIG   | 2 elements  | 1 element (0/1) |

By understanding the distinction between elements and operations in Bitcoin Script, you can better grasp how P2PK transactions function and how script validation works.

### Examples:

For a hands-on example, we can look at some of the very early Bitcoin transactions, many of which were P2PK.  
One notable transaction is from block 170 (**first Bitcoin transaction in history**), which includes a payment from Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney.

###### Example Details:

- **Transaction ID**: [f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16](https://mempool.space/tx/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16)

## P2PK Limitations and why we need P2PKH ?

### Problems with P2PK

P2PK (Pay to Public Key) presents several issues. Public keys are long (33 or 65 bytes), and when encoded in hexadecimal, their length doubles, making them hard for humans to read, transcribe, and communicate. This also results in a larger UTXO set because these keys must be stored and indexed, requiring more resources for full nodes. Additionally, public keys are visible on the bitcoin network, posing a potential security risk if ECDSA is ever broken.

### Solutions with P2PKH

P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) addresses these challenges by using a hashed version of the public key. This creates shorter, more manageable addresses by using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 to produce a 20-byte hash. It also enhances security by hiding the public key, providing additional protection against future attacks on ECDSA.

### Summary Table: P2PK vs. P2PKH

| Aspect             | P2PK                                   | P2PKH                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Address Length** | 33 or 65 bytes (66 or 130 characters)  | 20 bytes (40 characters)                     |
| **UTXO Set Size**  | Larger due to storing full public keys | Smaller due to storing hashes                |
| **Privacy**        | Public keys are visible                | Public keys are hashed, enhancing privacy    |
| **Security**       | Vulnerable if ECDSA is broken          | Additional layer of security through hashing |

### Example Address Comparison

| Format    | Example Length                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **P2PK**  | 130 characters (uncompressed SEC) |
| **P2PKH** | 40 characters (hash160)           |

By addressing the challenges of P2PK with P2PKH, Bitcoin transactions become more efficient, secure, and user-friendly.
